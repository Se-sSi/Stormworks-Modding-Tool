# Stormworks Modding Tool
This is a modding tool for the game Stormworks that I made. It edits the xml files to make custom blocks (MOD BLOCK FILES, not vehicle xml files). In the current version surface and voxel editing is available. In the future many more features are planned!

# How to download
To download simply download the "Stormworks Modding Tool.exe" file and run it. This can be done by clicking the "Stormworks Modding Tool.exe" file above then clicking the download button to the upper right. Or simply click the "code" button above and the "Download zip" and then extract the "Stormworks Modding Tool.exe" file and open it.

# How to use
When the program is opened you should start by loading in your pre existing xml file that you want to edit. Do this by clicking the "Load XML file" button and select the file wich you want to edit. You can also load a visual guide mesh from an obj file to help you know where to place the voxels and surfaces. 

# Disclaimer
This tool will override your old xml file that you are editing once you click the save button. So be causious when saving. It is recomended to make a copy.

Use this tool on your own risk. This tool may have plenty of bugs at the current state. 
Please give feedback on any bugs you may find and how to recreate them.

I am not affiliated with the Stormworks developers in any way.
