# Stormworks Modding Tool
This is a modding tool for the game Stormworks that I created. It edits the XML files to make custom blocks (**MOD BLOCK FILES**, not vehicle XML files). In the current version, surface and voxel editing is available, as well as file conversion. Many more features are planned!

# How to download üì•
To download simply download the "**Stormworks Modding Tool.exe**" file (for windows) or the MacOS files if you are using MacOS. Then run run the downloaded file.
- This can be done by clicking the "Stormworks Modding Tool.exe" file above then clicking the download button to the upper right.
- Or simply click the "code" button above and the "Download zip" and then extract the "Stormworks Modding Tool.exe" file and open it.

# How to use ‚ùî
When you open the program, start by loading in your pre existing **custom XML mod block file** that you want to edit. Click "**Load XML file**" and select the file you want to edit. See the chapters for further info of how to use the tool.

## Building modes üî®
### Voxel üî≤
**Voxels** are the **physical collision boxes** in-game, and the foundation for **surface** placements. They have different **positions**, **shapes**, **rotations** and **orientations**.
- There are **42 voxel shapes** (0-41), which define diffent collision boxes and **surface** placements.

### Surface üî∑
**Surfaces** are attachable (placeable) faces that you place on **voxel** faces.
- If the **attachment face** property is activate, the surface will be **visible** in-game (except shape 0, which is invisible).
- If the **fluid seal** property is active, but **attachment face** is not, the surface will be **invisible** but still act as a fluid seal.
- Surfaces can have different **positions**, **shapes**, **rotations** and **orientations**, but must be placed on a voxel face (though you can remove the voxel to create floating surfaces).
- There are **67 surface shapes** (0-66), which define diffent surface shapes to fit with the voxel shapes.

## Edit mode ‚úèÔ∏è
In **edit mode**, you can edit the **voxels** or **surfaces** (depending on the selected **bulding mode**) by clicking an object and changing it's properties on the right panel.

### Attachment face ‚¨áÔ∏è
An **attachment surface** is a property that makes a surface, a face that you can place blocks on in-game.

### Fluid seal üí¶
A **fluid seal** is a property that prevents **water**, **gases** and **space** from passing through a surface.

## Shape üî∑
- **Voxel shapes** (0-41) define the voxel and the physical collision shapes.
- **Surface shapes** (0-66) define the surface and visible in-game shapes.

## Rotation üîÅ
The **rotation** defines the how an object **spins around its forward direction**.
- Note that some **orientations** and **rotations** can result in the same vissible orientation.

## Position ‚ÜîÔ∏è
The **position** follows the Stormworks' **right-handed coordinate system:**
- **X = left/right**
- **Y = up/down**
- **Z = forward/backward**

## Orientation ‚ÜòÔ∏è
The **orientation** unlike the **rotation** makes the object's forward direction one of the **6** (0-5) different directions:
**0 = right**
**1 = left**
**2 = up**
**3 = down**
**4 = backward**
**5 = forward**

## Delete mode üóë
- **Delete mode** removes placed objects.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Undo does not work for deleted objects** in this version.

## Undo feature ‚Ü™Ô∏è
- **Undo** removes the last placed objects in the reverse order.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Undo** does not work for deleted objects.
- **Future versions may include undo for deletions.**

## Loading an XML file üìÇ
- To edit anything you must **load an existing valid XML file**.
- Click "**Load XML file**" and select your OBJ file.
- **This tool does not generate new XML files from scratch** (yet).

## Loading a visual guide üîé
Imports an OBJ file as a visual guide mesh for **voxel** and **surface** placement.
- Click "Load visual" and select your OBJ file.
- 1 block = 0.25x0.25x0.25m.

### Generating a voxel mesh from OBJ file üìê
You can generate **voxels** from a mesh
- The **vertices** in the OBJ file are **treated as the corners of the voxels** (0.25x0.25x0.25 m voxels).
- To use efficently:
- **Build** the mesh in Stormworks.
- **Export** while in the **Stormworks** editor by pressing "f11".
- **Import** the DEA file into **Blender**
- **Remove unecessary verticies** (recomended).
- **Export** as **OBJ file**.
- **Load the file inside** this tool.

## Saving üíæ
- Saves and **overrides** the current XML file.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **This cannot be undone, make backups before starting!**

### Save as
- Saves and **overrides** the selected XML file.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **This cannot be undone, make backups before starting!**

## Opacity options üëì
### Placeables opacity
- Adjust the **opacity** of **voxels** and **surfaces** (0%-100%) by moving the slider.

### Visual mesh opacity
- Adjust the **opacity** of the visual mesh guide (0%-100%) by moving the slider.

## Mirror mode üöß
- Comming in the next update 

## Other features üîß
### File converter üîÑ
The file converter converts between DAE and MESH files (also works with the texture compiler for texture files).
- Click the menu at the upper left of the window and select "**Convert files**" to go **to the file converter**
- Select your **Stormworks mesh compiler** (<c:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Stormworks/sdk/mesh_compiler.com>).
- **Select files** to convert.
- **Choose an output folder** (defaults to source folder).
- Click "**convert**" to convert your files from *.dea* to *.mesh*.
- You can go back to the editor by clicking "**Editor**" on the upper left of the window.

#### Use operating system file explorer option
- Changes between native and Godot file explorer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Native file explorer does not remember the last file conversion location.

# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **This tool will override your old XML file** when you save. Always make backups!
- **Use at your own risk.** There are many bugs.
